This script is an implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in Python. It can be used to perform basic experiments with PSO.

It was written by Nicolas Hoening (http://www.nicolashoening.de) with some inspiration by pseudocode of adaptiveview.com: http://www.adaptiveview.com/articles/ipsop1.html 

Actually, this is more than just the algorithm.
I added a lot of features to play with. For example:

* Several topologies (circle, star and geographical neighborhood)
* Some standard functions to test on (sphere,griewank,rastrigin,rosenbrock)
* Logging capabilities (to csv format, even code to plot graphs with that in GNU R can be produced)
* Experiment setups. Average over many iterations and/or automatically change conditions of your choice and let several trials run while you get a fresh cup of coffee :-)

To use it, navigate into the directory where the pypso directory resides, open a Python session and type:

$ import pypso.base
$ pypso.base.run()

(you can also navigate into the pypso directory and leave the "pypso."-parts away in the python-session) 

There are a lot of things to tweak with in the file conf.py.
